We are the world's people
Different yet we're the same
We believe
We believe in a dream
Praying for peace and healing
I hope we can start again
We believe
We believe in a dream
 
So if you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine
 
Chorus:
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun
A million voices
